# Butterkeks-FH CTF

A fictional, multi-stage hacking challenge set in the “Butterkeks Fachhochschule” environment. Each stage introduces a common vulnerability, guiding participants from basic reconnaissance to privilege escalation on a domain controller. The names in each step highlight the fictional users or admins who inadvertently reveal or misuse credentials.
Introduction

The Butterkeks-FH CTF tests a broad range of security concepts. Participants start by finding demo credentials in an old portal, then progress through SQL injection, file traversal, password reuse, and ultimately gain full control of the system. Each step features a unique vulnerability tied to a distinct user or scenario.
